Functions

Problem 1: Minimum
Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

The solution I wrote 100% of is in: 03e_01.js

Problem 2: Recursion
Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean. Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on –1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

Problem 3: Bean Counting
Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string. Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
